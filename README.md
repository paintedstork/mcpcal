eBird has data on the range of species.


IUCN uses MCP to calculate Extend of Occurrence (EOO) of each species.


This app helps calculate MCP from eBird data output.


IUCN provides the option to count constant sized squares of arbitrary size to calculate Are of Occupancy (AOO) of each species.


This app helps calculate AOO from eBird data output by defining the square size to be used.
